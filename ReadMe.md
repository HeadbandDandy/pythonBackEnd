## Python Back-End

### Introduction
This application is a Full-Stack Application that uses Python and allows users to Create, View, Update, and Delete Posts
The application is named BackOfFaceBook for giggles. This is a great way for people learning to program applications how to use
Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy.

### Installation
I am still learning to deploy an application via Azure and other Cloud Based Servers as my Free Trial during school ended. But to run this application locally, copy and paste the repository into your IDE. Once the code is copied over pip/pip3 install any of the packages that may be missing. After the packages and dependencies are installed in your integrated terminal run python -m flask run OR python3 -m flask run.
